# Climate Hub Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your credentials

# ===== Logging Configuration =====
# Log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Log format: json or text
# json - Machine-readable structured logs
# text - Human-readable console output
LOG_FORMAT=json

# Optional: Log file path (uncomment to enable file logging)
# LOG_FILE=/app/logs/climate-hub.log

# ===== AC Freedom Cloud Credentials =====
# Option 1: Use environment variables (less secure, convenient for Docker)
CLIMATE_HUB_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
CLIMATE_HUB_PASSWORD=your-password

# Option 2: Use config file (recommended for security)
# Mount your local config directory to /root/.config/climate-hub
# The webapp will auto-load credentials from config.json
# Use 'climate login' CLI command to create the config file

# ===== Application Settings =====
# Port for the webapp container (internal port is always 8000)
# Host port is configured in docker-compose.yml (default: 8090)

# ===== Notes =====
# - If both env vars and config file are present, env vars take precedence
# - For production, use config file instead of env vars for better security
# - If password contains $ character, escape it with $$ for docker-compose (e.g., pass$$word)
# - Never commit the .env file to version control
